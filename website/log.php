<!--
How would it be if I put all information from the two tables together in one in the right order and then do the while loop thing ?!

SELECT Log_Type, Log_ID, User_ID, Log_Item_ID, Charge_Amount, Balance, Timestamp
FROM (
    SELECT 'Order' AS Log_Type, Order_ID AS Log_ID, User_ID, Product_ID AS Log_Item_ID, NULL AS Charge_Amount, Old_Balance AS Balance, Timestamp
    FROM order_log
    UNION ALL
    SELECT 'Charge' AS Log_Type, Charge_ID AS Log_ID, User_ID, NULL AS Log_Item_ID, Amount_Charged AS Charge_Amount, New_Balance AS Balance, Timestamp
    FROM charge_log
) AS CombinedLog
ORDER BY Timestamp DESC;


//Code before:-->
<h1>COMBINED LOG</h1>

include("connection.php");

// Fetch order logs
